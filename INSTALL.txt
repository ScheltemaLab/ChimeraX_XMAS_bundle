- Store the 'bundle_info.xml' file and the 'src' folder in a folder of choice. The 'src' folder should contain:
  - A 'docs' folder
  - An '__init__.py' file
  - A 'tool.py' file
- In the ChimeraX application, run the command 'devel install “[path/to/folder_of_choice]”'
- Pip install the required modules (pandas and openpyxl) on the ChimeraX console, by running the following commands via your command prompt:
  - '"[path/to/console]" -m pip install pandas --user'
  - '"[path/to/console]" -m pip install openpyxl --user'
For example, my [path/to/console] is C:\Program Files\ChimeraX 1.2.5\bin\ChimeraX-console.exe
- The bundle can be found in the ChimeraX application under Tools - General as 'Crosslink Mapper'
