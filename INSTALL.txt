1.  Store the 'bundle_info.xml' file and the 'src' folder in a folder of choice. The 'src' folder should contain the following files:
    - '__init__.py'
    - 'tool.py'
2.  In the ChimeraX application, run the command 'devel install “[path/to/folder_of_choice]”'.
    NB if warnings about the matplotlib-venn package are displayed in ChimeraX's log, install this package manually
    on the ChimeraX console. This is done by running the following command via your command prompt:
    - '"[path/to/console]" -m easy_install matplotlib-venn --user' (for example, my [path/to/console] is
      'C:\Program Files\ChimeraX 1.2.5\bin\ChimeraX-console.exe')
    Then repeat step 2.
The bundle can be found in the ChimeraX application under 'Tools' - 'Structure Analysis' as 'XMAS'
